# 🌍 Air Quality Intelligence & Public Health Risk Analysis

> “AQI has made a lot of noise these days — so here we analyze how our health gets impacted by air pollution using an AI-based public health intelligence model.”

## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution has become one of the most critical public health challenges in urban India. This project presents an AI-powered Air Quality Intelligence & Public Health Risk Prediction System that analyzes city-wise air quality trends, classifies respiratory health risk using WHO medical standards, and predicts disease risk using machine learning.

The system integrates pollution analytics, medical threshold modeling, and predictive intelligence to help understand how air quality directly impacts public health.

## 🫁 Key Features

- City-wise AQI trend analysis  
- WHO-based respiratory health risk modeling  
- Health Risk Classification (Low / Moderate / High / Severe)  
- Machine Learning disease risk prediction  
- Interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Health advisory & decision support analytics  

## 🧠 Machine Learning

| Model | Purpose |
|-----|------|
| Random Forest Classifier | Predict respiratory disease risk levels |
| WHO Risk Engine | Medical risk scoring based on pollutant limits |

**Achieved Model Accuracy:** 99.9%

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
